            <p>Nikola Tesla was a Serbian-American inventor, electrical engineer, mechanical engineer, and futurist best
               known for his contributions to the design of the modern alternating current (AC) electricity supply
               system.</p>

               <ul>
                  <li><b>1856</b> - Born in Smiljan, Crotia.</li>
                  <li><b>1870</b> - Studied engineering and physics, gaining practical experience in the early working
                     in
                     telephony and at Continental Edison.</li>
                  <li><b>1884</b> - Emigrated to the United States</li>
                  <li><b>1887</b> - Tesla and Alfred S.Brown together formed the Tesla Electric Company.</li>
                  <li><b>1891</b> - On 30 July, aged 35, Tesla became a naturalized citizen of the United States. In the
                     same year, he patented his Tesla coil.</li>
                  <li><b>1890</b> - Tesla experimented with transmitting power by inductive and capacitive coupling
                     using
                     high AC voltages generated with his Tesla coil. He attempted to develop a wireless lighting
                     system based on near-field inductive and capacitive coupling.</li>
                  <li><b>1898</b> - Tesla demonstrated a boat that used a coherer-based radio control—which he dubbed
                     "telautomaton"—to the public during an electrical exhibition at Madison Square Garden</li>
                  <li><b>1901</b> - Tesla built Wardenclyffe tower, a powerful transmitter which is ideally for viable
                     system of wireless transmission. </li>
                  <li><b>1905</b> - The Wardenclyffe project came to a halt due to the financial problems and other
                     events.
                  </li>
                  <li><b>1915</b> - Tesla mortagaged the Wardenclyffe property to cover his debts. Later, the tower was
                     demolished by the new owner.</li>
                  <li><b>1922</b> - He moved to the St. Regis Hotel and followed a pattern from then on of moving to a
                     different hotel every few years and leaving unpaid bills behind. </li>
                  <li><b>1934</b> - Tesla moved to the Hotel New Yorker. At this time Westinghouse Electric &
                     Manufacturing
                     Company began paying him $125 per month in addition to paying his rent.</li>
                  <li><b>1943</b> - On 7 January, at the age of 86, Tesla died in Room 3327 of the Hotel New Yorker.
